[Think Stats Chapter 4 Exercise 2](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2005.html#toc41) (a random distribution)

---

_The numbers generated by random.random are supposed to be uniform between 0 and 1; that is, every value in the range should have the same probability.
Generate 1000 numbers from random.random and plot their PMF and CDF. Is the distribution uniform?_

---

Generate 1000 random numbers between 0 and 1 and store it as a variable called ```nums```.

```
nums = np.random.random(1000)
```

Create the Pmf object for this array using the thinkstats2.Pmf() function.

```
pmf = thinkstats2.Pmf(nums, label = 'random nums')
```

Then, create the PMF plot using the thinkplot library:

```
thinkplot.Pmf(pmf)
thinkplot.Config(xlabel = 'number', ylabel = 'PMF')
```

This will create a strange looking PMF plot where the distribution appears uniform since the probability associated with any given value between 0 and 1 is equivalent.

Now, to look at what the CDF would look like for this array of numbers, create the Cdf object.

```
cdf = thinkstats2.Cdf(nums, label = 'random nums')
```

Create the CDF plot:

```
thinkplot.Cdf(cdf)
thinkplot.Config(xlabel = 'number', ylabel = 'CDF')
```

The CDF plot also indicates that this data is uniformly distributed.
